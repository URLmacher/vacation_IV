# vacation_iv
A small game created to boost my chances of getting my vacation days approved.

Inspired by [Learn 2D Game Development with JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvC3ge_puQk) by Frank's laboratory and using assets from itch.io.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm run dev
```
